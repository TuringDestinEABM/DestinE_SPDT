## Quick start
[TODO: write quick start]


## House keeping

This file structure is temporary and is likely to change as the project evolves. For now:
1. Anything concerning modelling should go into /modelling
2. Functionality for the digital twin should go into /other
3. Any static data (e.g. images, datasets, maps etc. that will be the same every time) should go into static. Keep like with like in subfolders, creating new folders as needed
4. Anything without a home should go into /other. We should try and kee this folder as empty as possible, if it gets too full we should reorganise
5. Anything that shouldn't be uploaded to Github should be added to the .gitignore. Any passwords/ user credentials etc. should be filed under /other/private
